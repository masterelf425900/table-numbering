# table-numbering
A simple obsidian plugin to automatically insert and update numbered rows in tables.
#### How it works
1. you select a row in a table
2. you use the "insert numbered row below" from the command palette
3. a new row will made below the selected row and if that row had any number formated as 1. 2. 3. etc. then they and next rows will get upadted accordingly.

no doubt its a niche scenario. I needed it for my games, movies and tv-shows tracking. Maybe some people will find it helpful.

#### how to install
1. download the main.js and manifest.json files
2. put them in a folder with any name I name mine "table-numbering" for easy navigation.
3. put that folder in your vaults plugin folder. Mine looks like this A:\Projects\Obsidian\Reflections\.obsidian\plugins\table-numbering
